**HELLO** 
My Name is Drew Swanberg.

I Teach Debate to highschoolers and run an IT Consultancy for small businesess and non-profits. 

Bespoke IT LLC specializes in custom automation and data collection tools. In todays digital world every business is a digital business. Automation offers cost efficency, and the ability to delegate less desirable jobs. As a business automation allows for efficency and profit optimization, but as a nonprofit the goal is doing more for the cause you support with fewer resources time and headache.



I also develop goofy projects for fun, im working on a party game platform (Like jackbox). 
My card game project is pretty cool, grab a friend and try it out sometime if you like card games.
